## What is this?

It's the place where we CI/CD everything over https://play-with-ghost.com/

Everyday, these themes are build and pushed to PWG:

## Live Demo

Want to try Ghost quickly? This is for you!

[play-with-ghost.com](https://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to learn about Ghost. What's remarkable here, is that you have the option to log into the admin panel of each live demo available, by using dummy credentials.

In short, you can try Ghost on the spot without having to sign-up!

## DevOps best practices

Let's understand our processes. In this post Â« [How we update hundreds of Ghost's websites on Docker Swarm?](https://firepress.org/en/how-we-update-hundreds-of-ghosts-websites-on-docker-swarm/) Â», we explain how we deploy Ghost in production and which best practices we do follow.

## Developing Ghost themes locally

I open-sourced [my setup here](https://github.com/firepress-org/ghost-local-dev-in-docker). Itâ€™s a workflow to run Ghost locally within a Docker container. Once your local paths are defined, itâ€™s enjoyable and easy to work **between many themes**.

<br>

## FirePress Hosting

At FirePress we empower entrepreneurs and small organizations to create their websites on top of [Ghost](https://firepress.org/en/faq/#what-is-ghost).

At the moment, our **pricing** for hosting one Ghost website is $15 (Canadian dollars). This price will be only available for our first 100 new clients, starting May 1st, 2019 ðŸ™Œ. [See our pricing section](https://firepress.org/en/pricing/) for details.

More details [about this announcement](https://forum.ghost.org/t/host-your-ghost-website-on-firepress/7092/1) on Ghost's forum.
